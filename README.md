I created a simple yet fun number guessing game using C++. 
In this game, the computer generates a secret number in the range of 1 to 100, and the player has to guess it.
The game has three difficulty levels. A player’s chances of guessing are limited by the level they choose. The easy level gives the player 10 chances to guess the secret number, the medium level 7 chances, whereas the difficult level only offers 5 chances.
During the game, a player tells the computer his assumption about a number, and the computer tells if the player is correct. If his number is less or more than the secret number, the computer informs the player, and the player tries again. 
The player can also end the game at any time.
